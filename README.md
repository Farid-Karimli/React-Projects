# React-Projects

This repository includes all the React projects I have created during my learning process. The projects go from really simple to more complicated and sophisticated. 

They demonstrate knowledge in React basics, including class and functional components, event handling, conditional rendering, as well Hooks and lifecycle controls.
In addition, the projects also show proficiency in HTML, CSS and JavaScript/ES6.
